Farming simulator game coded using python.  Credit of base mechanics/code setup to ClearCode YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4IX36sP_0c).  Some of the graphics were purchased from Cup Noodle's Sprout Lands Asset Pack on itch.io.
Game map is custom - I used Tiled to design my map and import it into my project.  Beyond the base game/setup from ClearCode, I added a leveling/xp system which allows you to unlock new crops and map locations as you progress, an
in-game shop where you can sell your crops and buy new seeds, the player's house/spawning point, a travelling system that allows you to use the boat to teleport to the trader island, an inventory gui allowing the player to see what they have collected, on-screen display of tool/seed selection/money/xp/level, expanded features and functionality to have more crops and harvestable trees/bushes (both chopping trees down and harvesting various foods from bushes and trees), added functionality to weather and allowed rain to hydrate tilled soil, regrowth of trees and fruits on bushes/trees, a semi-functional save system using writing and reading from txt files allowing users to save inventory contents, money, xp/level, crop locations, etc, and several other features.
